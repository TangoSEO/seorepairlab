export const prerender = false; // We need SSR for this page if we wanted, but actually standard static page + client side fetch works too. 
// However, since we are fetching from an internal API route /api/analyze, that API route requires SSR or output: 'server'/'hybrid' in Astro config.
// The default Astro config usually is static. Let's check if the user has SSR enabled. 
// Looking at package.json, `astro build` suggests static site generation. 
// BUT `src/pages/api/analyze.ts` only works if the output is server or hybrid.
// If the site is purely static, we cannot host the API route easily unless we use an adapter (Vercel/Netlify).
// The user has `vercel.json` and `netlify.toml`, so likely deploying there.
// If the mode is static, API routes render to static files at build time... which won't work for dynamic input.
// We'll assume the user has a way to run API functions (hybrid) or we act as if it's SPA.
// Actually, for a fully static site, we can't really have an internal dynamic API route without an adapter.
// But let's proceed assuming standard Astro hybrid/server capabilities or that the user will configure the adapter.
// Wait, for `output: 'static'` (default), API routes are built at build time.
// If the user wants dynamic API, they need an adapter.
// I will add `export const prerender = false` to be safe if they are in hybrid mode, 
// but if they are static, this might fail or just not work as expected.
// Given the prompt "create a page... and backend", I'm assuming server capabilities.
