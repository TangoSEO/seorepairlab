                <p>My journey to technical SEO wasn't direct—it was built on a foundation of IT systems and logistics.</p>
                <p>I started my career in IT support for companies like <strong>Cisco and MSN</strong> during the dial-up era, learning how networks and systems function from the ground up. Later, as an International Trade Manager, I spent years optimizing complex logistics with data, spreadsheets, and scripts.</p>
                <p>In 2017, I pivoted fully into SEO, where my systems-thinking background became my greatest asset. I don't just see keywords; I see the technical infrastructure that allows them to rank.</p>
                <p>I am currently pursuing a <strong>Systems Engineering degree at UNICEN</strong> to deepen my backend knowledge. I thrive on solving the complex technical puzzles that drive real business growth.</p>
                <p>When I'm not analyzing log files, you can find me experimenting with new web frameworks or contributing to technical SEO communities.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold uppercase tracking-tight mb-6">Beyond the Code</h2>
                <p>I'm not just an SEO; I'm a systems thinker who loves solving puzzles. I live in <strong>Tandil, Argentina</strong>, where I balance deep technical work with enjoying life.</p>
                <p>I spent years in logistics and IT support before finding my home in SEO. That background means I don't panic when things break—I just look for the logic error and fix it.</p>
                <p>I believe in clear communication, honest deadlines, and treating your business with the same care I treat my own.</p>
